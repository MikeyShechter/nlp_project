1. run the experiment on several hyperparameters (experiment format: {score_threshold}_{embedding_method}_{clustering_method}.png):
    a. change percentile - try 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 ...
    b. use different clustering methodologies - KMEANS, DBSCAN, LDA (?) Ozzzz + Yahav
    c. Different number of clusters Ozzzz
2. think how to evaluate the results
    a. Variance of clusters - Done basically, maybe find a better metric
    b. Variance of layers TODO think about how
3. label interesting clusters with topics (reverse word2vec?)
    a. If not for all clusters, take best clusters (lowest variance)
4. Open Notion of tasks Ozzzz
