# Clustering Neuron Explanations in Large Language Models

This repository contains the code and resources used for the experiments described in the project [Clustering Neuron Explanations in Language Models](./Clustering_Neuron_Explanations_in_Language_Models.pdf). The project explores the application of various clustering algorithms and topic modeling to analyze meaningful patterns in neuron explanations within GPT-2 XL.
